# What is Numerical Method?

Numerical Method is the method of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis.

Tools: Scilab Software (Alternative: Matlab)

In Numerical Method, there are several subtopics I learned:
1. Introduction: Basic operations
2. Nonlinear equation system solving with bracketing method
3. Nonlinear equation system solving with open method
4. Polynomial system
5. Linear equation system
6. Interpolation
7. Derivative
8. Integration
9. Ordinary differential equations
